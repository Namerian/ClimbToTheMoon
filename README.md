Climb To The Moon

A 2D mobile game for Android made with Unity and shipped on the Google Play Store.

The goal is for the player to climb as high as possible while avoiding obstacles and collecting bonuses.

The game was produced in two weeks (2/27 - 3/9) by a team of 3 designers, 3 artists and myself as programmer.
